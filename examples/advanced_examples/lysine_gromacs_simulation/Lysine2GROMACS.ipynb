The recommended representation of your substrate is Stereo SMILES (you can learn more about this representation [here](http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html). A PDB file is typically not sufficient.  You can read the OpenFF FAQ for more details [here](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html). If you do not know the SMILES string and cannot obtain it from a collaborator, you can use the following procedure to obtain it for substrates inside of the Protein Data Bank.\n",

    "4.\tWith the SMILES string and PDB in place, we can now go ahead and produce the topology and structure files for simulations with GROMACS or CHARMM. The workflow for this involves an initial conversion to an OpenMM system, followed by a conversion with ParmED to GROMACS or CHARMM topology and structure files.  For this you can copy the following python script into an ipython shell (change directory to where you downloaded the LYS_ideal.pdb, type “ipython” into the terminal and don’t forget to activate the environment with “conda activate openff”) or notebook (expect a warning that the OpenEyeToolkit cannot be imported, which can safely be ignored as you do not need a license for the rest of this tutorial):"
